/// split at every empty horizontal gap into <i>bands</i>, taken top → bottom; each band recurses (its
/// blocks may themselves form sub-columns). Recursion stops when a leaf holds a single block, or when no
/// further clean cut exists (the leaf's blocks are then emitted top-to-bottom / left-to-right). The result
/// is the natural multi-column reading order — every block of the left column is read fully before the
